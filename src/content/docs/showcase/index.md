# Live Showcase

Experience Strata in action with these interactive demos. Each demo runs directly in your browser using WebGL.

## Featured Demos

<div class="feature-grid">

### 🏔️ [Terrain Demo](/showcase/terrain/)
Procedural terrain generation using SDFs and marching cubes with triplanar texturing and multi-biome blending.

### 🌊 [Water Demo](/showcase/water/)
Realistic water rendering featuring Gerstner wave simulation, Fresnel-based reflections, procedural foam, and underwater caustics.

### 🌿 [Vegetation Demo](/showcase/vegetation/)
GPU-accelerated instancing capable of rendering 10,000+ instances of grass, trees, and rocks at 60fps with procedural wind animation.

### ☀️ [Sky & Volumetrics Demo](/showcase/sky/)
Physically-based atmospheric scattering with dynamic day/night cycle, volumetric clouds, and god rays.

### 🎬 [Full Scene Demo](/showcase/full-scene/)
Complete integration of all features into a cohesive explorable environment.

## Running Demos Locally

Clone the examples repository and run locally for the best experience:

```bash
# Clone examples
git clone https://github.com/strata-game-library/examples.git
cd examples

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run specific demos
pnpm dev:terrain    # Port 3000
pnpm dev:water      # Port 3001
pnpm dev:vegetation # Port 3002
pnpm dev:sky        # Port 3003
```

## What These Demos Showcase

| Demo | Features Demonstrated |
|------|----------------------|
| Terrain | SDF, Marching Cubes, Biomes, Triplanar Texturing |
| Water | Gerstner Waves, Reflections, Caustics, Foam |
| Vegetation | GPU Instancing, Wind Animation, LOD |
| Sky | Atmospheric Scattering, Day/Night, Stars |
| Full Scene | All features integrated together |

## Performance

All demos are optimized for:
- ✅ Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- ✅ Low-end devices (with reduced settings)

If performance is poor, try:
1. Closing other browser tabs
2. Using a discrete GPU (if available)
3. Reducing browser window size
