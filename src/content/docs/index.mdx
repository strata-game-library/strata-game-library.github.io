## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install @strata-game-library/core @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three
```

```tsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { Water, ProceduralSky, GrassInstances, VolumetricFogMesh } from '@strata-game-library/core';

function Game() {
  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 10, 20] }}>
      <ProceduralSky sunPosition={[100, 50, 100]} />
      <Water size={200} depth={20} />
      <GrassInstances count={10000} spread={100} />
      <VolumetricFogMesh density={0.02} />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

## Why Strata?

| Feature | Without Strata | With Strata |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Terrain System | 2000+ lines | ~50 lines |
| Water Rendering | 1500+ lines | ~20 lines |
| Vegetation | 1000+ lines | ~30 lines |
| Full Scene | 5000+ lines | ~200 lines |

**10x code reduction.** Build complete 3D worlds in under 1,000 lines of code.

## Architecture

Strata is organized into three layers, each building on the previous:

<div class="layer-stack">
  <div class="layer layer-4">Layer 4: Presets & Game Framework</div>
  <div class="layer layer-3">Layer 3: React Three Fiber Components</div>
  <div class="layer layer-2">Layer 2: Core Algorithms (SDF, Noise, Marching Cubes, Materials)</div>
  <div class="layer layer-1">Layer 1: GLSL Shaders</div>
  <div class="layer layer-0">Layer 0: TypeScript Types & Utilities</div>
</div>
