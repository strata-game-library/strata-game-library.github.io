# Introduction to Strata

**Strata** is a comprehensive procedural 3D graphics library for React Three Fiber. It provides everything you need to build high-quality 3D games and experiences—from terrain generation to character animation—all optimized for performance across mobile, web, and desktop.

## What is Strata?

The name *Strata* comes from geology: layers of rock or soil with internally consistent characteristics that distinguish them from contiguous layers. This perfectly embodies our framework:

- **Geological Metaphor**: Building worlds layer by layer, from terrain foundations to atmospheric effects
- **Framework Architecture**: From core algorithms → React components → Game framework
- **Technical Precision**: Deliberate, structured, scientifically grounded

## Core Features

### 🏔️ Procedural Terrain
SDF-based terrain generation using marching cubes algorithm with triplanar texturing and multi-biome blending.

```tsx
import { Terrain } from '@strata/core';

<Terrain 
  biomes={['grassland', 'mountain', 'desert']}
  resolution={128}
  size={1000}
/>
```

### 🌊 Advanced Water
Realistic water rendering with Gerstner wave simulation, Fresnel-based reflections, procedural foam, and underwater caustics.

```tsx
import { Water, AdvancedWater } from '@strata/core';

<Water size={200} depth={20} />
<AdvancedWater size={200} waveHeight={2} reflections caustics />
```

### 🌿 GPU Vegetation
GPU-accelerated instancing capable of rendering 10,000+ instances at 60fps with procedural wind animation.

```tsx
import { GrassInstances, TreeInstances, RockInstances } from '@strata/core';

<GrassInstances count={10000} spread={100} />
<TreeInstances count={500} spread={200} />
<RockInstances count={200} spread={150} />
```

### ☀️ Procedural Sky
Physically-based atmospheric scattering with dynamic day/night cycle, stars, and sun/moon positioning.

```tsx
import { ProceduralSky, createTimeOfDay } from '@strata/core';

<ProceduralSky timeOfDay={createTimeOfDay(14, 30)} />
```

### 🌫️ Volumetric Effects
God rays, volumetric fog, underwater overlays, and atmospheric effects.

```tsx
import { VolumetricFogMesh, UnderwaterOverlay, EnhancedFog } from '@strata/core';

<VolumetricFogMesh density={0.02} color="#8899aa" />
<UnderwaterOverlay depth={10} />
```

### 🎮 Character System
Articulated character system with IK chains, procedural walk cycles, and physics integration.

```tsx
import { Character, createWalkCycle } from '@strata/core';

<Character 
  model={characterModel}
  animation={createWalkCycle({ speed: 1.5 })}
/>
```

## Package Ecosystem

Strata is organized into several focused packages:
